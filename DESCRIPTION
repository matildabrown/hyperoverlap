Title: Overlap Detection in n-Dimensional Space
Version: 1.1.2
Description: Uses support vector machines to identify a perfectly separating hyperplane (linear or curvilinear) between two entities in high-dimensional space. If this plane exists, the entities do not overlap. Applications include overlap detection in morphological, resource or environmental dimensions. More details can be found in: Brown et al. (2020) <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13363> .
